# KZones

<img align="right" width="125" height="75" src="./media/icon.png">

KDE KWin Script for snapping windows into zones. Handy when using a (super) ultrawide monitor, an alternative to PowerToys FancyZones and Windows 11 snap layouts.

## Features

### Zone Selector

The zone selector is a small widget that appears when you drag a window to the top of the screen. It allows you to snap the window to a zone regardless of the current layout.

### Zone Overlay

The zone overlay is a fullscreen overlay that appears when you move a window. It shows all zones from the current layout and the window will snap to the zone you drop it on.

### Multiple Layouts

Create multiple layouts and cycle between them.

### Shortcuts

KZones comes with a set of shortcuts to move your windows between zones and layouts.

### Theming

By using the same colors as your selected color scheme, KZones will blend in perfectly with your desktop.

### KDE Store

https://store.kde.org/p/1909220

### Build it yourself
Make sure you have "zip" installed on your system before building.
```
git clone https://github.com/gerritdevriese/kzones
cd kzones && ./build
```

## Configuration

### General

#### Zone Selector

The zone selector is a small widget that appears when you drag a window to the top of the screen. It allows you to snap the window to a zone regardless of the current layout.

- Enable or disable the zone selector.
- Set the distance from the top of the screen at which the zone selector will start to appear.

#### Zone Overlay

The zone overlay is a fullscreen overlay that appears when you move a window. It shows all zones from the current layout and the window will snap to the zone you drop it on.

- Enable or disable the zone overlay.
- Choose whether the overlay should be shown when you start moving a window or when you press the toggle overlay shortcut.
- Choose where the cursor needs to be in order to highlight a zone, either in the center of the zone or anywhere inside the zone.

#### Remember and restore window geometries

The script will remember the geometry of each window when it's moved to a zone. When the window is moved out of the zone, it will be restored to it's original geometry.

- Enable or disable this behavior.

### Layouts

You can define your own layouts by modifying the JSON in the **Layouts** tab in the script settings, here are some examples to get you started:

#### Examples
<details open>
  <summary>Single layout</summary>

```json
[
    {
        "name": "Layout 1",
        "padding": 10,
        "zones": [
            {
                "name": "1",
                "x": 0,
                "y": 0,
                "height": 100,
                "width": 25
            },
            {
                "name": "2",
                "x": 25,
                "y": 0,
                "height": 100,
                "width": 50
            },
            {
                "name": "3",
                "x": 75,
                "y": 0,
                "height": 100,
                "width": 25

#### Explanation

The main array can contain as many layouts as you want:
   
Each **layout** object needs the following keys:
- `name`: The name of the layout, shown when cycling between layouts
- `padding`: The amount of space between the window and the zone in pixels
- `zones`: An array containing all zone objects for this layout

Each **zone** object needs the following keys:
- `x`, `y`: position of the top left corner of the zone in screen percentage
- `width`, `height`: size of the zone in screen percentage

### Filters

Stop certain windows from snapping to zones by adding them to the filter list.

- Select the filter mode, either **Include** or **Exclude**.
- Add window classes to the list seperated by a newline.

You can enable debug mode to see the window class of the active window.

### Advanced

#### Polling rate

The polling rate is the amount of time between each zone check when dragging a window. The default is 100ms, a faster polling rate is more accurate but will use more CPU. You can change this to your liking.

#### Debug mode

When debug mode is enabled, the script will log more information and show extra information in the overlay.

## Shortcuts

List of all available shortcuts:

| Shortcut                                  | Default Binding  |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Move active window to zone                | `Ctrl+Alt+[0-9]` |
| Move active window to previous zone       | `Ctrl+Alt+Left`  |
| Move active window to next zone           | `Ctrl+Alt+Right` |
| Switch to previous window in current zone | `Ctrl+Alt+Down`  |
| Switch to next window in current zone     | `Ctrl+Alt+Up`    |
| Cycle between layouts                     | `Ctrl+Alt+D`     |
| Toggle zone overlay                       | `Ctrl+Alt+C`     |

*To change the default bindings, go to System Settings / Shortcuts and search for KZones*

## Troubleshooting

### The script doesn't work

- Check if your KDE Plasma version is at 5.27 or higher.
- Make sure there is at least one layout defined in the script settings and that it contains at least one zone.

### My settings are not saved

- After changing settings, you need to reload the script by disabling, saving and enabling it again. This is a known issue with the KWin Scripting API.

### The screen turns black while moving a window

- Make sure your compositor is enabled, as it is needed to draw transparent windows.
- You can find this setting in Plasma settings: Display and Monitor - Compositor
